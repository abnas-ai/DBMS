##    Core concepts - RDBMS
-Relation/table -
-Tuple(row) - single record in a table
-Primary key(ID)
-Foreign key - primary key in another table
-Schema

## Advantages of RDBMS
-Data independence
-Structured Structured Query Language
-Data integrity
-ACID Properties(Atomicity, consistency, Isolation, Durability)
-Normalized data
